# Mini Track Services
Welcome to the future (or the past) [depending on when you're reading this].

Gone are the days when you had to construct huge rail yards and cargo stations, especially when there was no place for them in rural areas. This is more important to use "Historical Start" mod or to detail your station around these.

This mod includes 4 single fixed-length bi-directional tracks which function as both passenger and cargo stations and a rail yard. All three have two upgrades each, which include additional tracks (can be placed in as much space as you have and do not require road access) and a non-visual extension upgrade for comfort, storage and maintenance respectively.

But if you're counting that's just 3, what's the other one? The other one is a hybrid track which acts as all three at once. Trains can spawn from it and can pick up passengers and cargo (on separate trains).

You can find all the items in the existing Trains tab in the Transportation menu.

# Asset Set Details
* Total Count: 10
* Primary: 4
* UI priority: Train > 500 - 504
* Icons: Redesigned from "Asset Icon Library"
* Upgrades: 6

# DISCLAIMER
* Safe to remove. This mod will not break your save if removed. However the assets will no longer work.
* This mod may require ***Asset Packs Manager*** which is highly experimental. This mod shouldn't break the save game. But subscribing to assets that require this without the dependency will pop up errors. Worst case you'll get error popups on game load and/or grey boxes in save. But either way, YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE for any damage. Contact me on Discord and I'll try to help you recover anyway.
