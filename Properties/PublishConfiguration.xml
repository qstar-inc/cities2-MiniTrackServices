# Mini Track Services
Welcome to the future (or the past) [depending on when you're reading this].

Gone are the days where you have to construct huge rail yard and cargo stations, specially there's no place for them in a rural area. More important if you want to use "Historical Start" mod or you want to detail your own station around these.

This mod includes 4 single fixed length bi-directional tracks which functions as both passenger and cargo stations and a rail yard. All three has two upgrades each, which includes additional tracks (can be placed as much space you have and does not require road access) and a non-visual extension upgrade for each for comfort, storage and maintenance respectively.

But if you're counting that's just 3, what's the other one? The other one is a hybrid track which acts as all three at once. Trains can spawn from it, can pick up passengers and cargo (on separate trains).

You can find all the items in a the existing Trains tab in the Transportation menu.

# Asset Set Details

# DISCLAIMER
* Safe to remove. This mod will not break your save if removed. However the assets will no longer work.
* This mod may require ***Asset Packs Manager*** which is highly experimental. This mod shouldn't break the save game. But subscribing to assets that require this without the dependency will pop up errors. Worst case you'll get error popups on game load and/or grey boxes in save. But either way, YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE for any damage. Contact me on Discord and I'll try to help you recover anyway.
