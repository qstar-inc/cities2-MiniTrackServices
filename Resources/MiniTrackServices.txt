# Mini Track Services
Welcome to the future (or the past) [depending on when you're reading this].

Gone are the days when you had to construct huge rail yards and cargo stations, especially when there was no place for them in rural areas. This is more important to use "Historical Start" mod or to detail your station around these.

This mod includes modular train/tram/subway tracks which works as depo or stations.

You can find all the items in the existing Trains tab in the Transportation menu.
